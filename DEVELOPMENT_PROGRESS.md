# Development progress

This file records measured implementation checkpoints for the generalized
scanner review. It is deliberately limited to repository and fixture facts;
private conversation archives and ignored image material remain outside Git.

## Checkpoint: 2026-08-10

### Repository and runtime baseline at review start

- Local branch: `main`.
- Review started at `8ac66a0` (`feat: generalize scanner across held-out
  tilesets`), with the cached `origin/main` ref at `acc6883`.
- The first two review checkpoints were subsequently committed and pushed;
  the current branch tip is recorded in the Git history rather than repeated
  in this historical baseline section.
- Working tree was clean before this checkpoint.
- The documented app command is `python -m jtool_scanner.cli app`; the local
  app is healthy at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/health` (HTTP 200).
- The full suite passed before this checkpoint: 302 tests, `OK`.
- After the change and its regression test were added, the full suite passed:
  303 tests in 536.421 seconds, `OK`.

### Golden-room benchmark

The FTFA benchmark was rerun with the repository's exact workflow and
`grid_step=8`, geometry and color scanning enabled.

| run | exact | false positives | missed | shifted | wrong direction |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| baseline before this checkpoint | 924/928 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0 |
| after save-anchor correction | 926/928 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 |

The remaining misses are the weak lower-right and left-edge boundary slivers
in FTFA screen 1. `tests/test_unseen_regressions.py` explicitly protects the
decision not to promote the weak lower-right sliver to a block. FTFA therefore
continues to meet the current strict benchmark threshold without false
positives.

### Generalized change in this batch

Warm/outlined terrain marker reconciliation now prefers a candidate with a
full support cell at the candidate origin over an equally supported candidate
that only obtains its support by straddling adjacent cells. This removes the
8-pixel phase drift seen in scaled FTFA screen captures while retaining the
existing terrain-overlap and side-support safeguards. A synthetic regression
test covers the adjacent-cell tie topology.

### Representative fixture baseline

The Irkara color-object workflow remains stable after the change:

- saves: 23/23 matched, 30 detected;
- warps: 8/11 matched, 8 detected;
- water: 506/520 matched, 506 detected;
- walljumps: 7/7 matched, 20 detected;
- apples and gravity objects: no truth cases in this manifest.

The 71-screen giant-review manifest and its local review ledger remain
available for staged visual review. Their current ledger labels are review
bookkeeping, not authoritative corrected JMaps; Lap Around still lacks
corrected JMaps and is not an exact benchmark. A previous full geometry scan
of the large block/spike manifest exceeded the operational command timeout,
so it is not treated as a completed measurement.

## Next review focus

The next batch should use a small, explicitly measured group from the
unrecognized/reverse tileset families (CN3-16/CN3-18 and NANG-128/NANG-128r)
and compare source, current JTool reconstruction, and blend output. Candidate
rules must be palette-relative and shape/terrain-supported rather than keyed to
screen names or absolute colors. Existing FTFA exact results, the Lap/CN3/NANG
fixture scans, and the object-specific regression tests remain gates for every
subsequent change.

No claim is made here that all 71 screens are complete. Each later checkpoint
must include the changed rule, the measured before/after result, affected
fixtures, and any remaining visual uncertainty.

## Checkpoint: compact vertical-spike support (2026-08-10)

The compact-room detector previously accepted bright neutral seams as vertical
mini-spikes when they had no playable support-cell phase. The shared compact
rule now requires an up/down mini-spike to align with the corresponding native
full-tile support edge. Occluded horizontal mini-spike recovery remains a
separate path because its support geometry is different.

Measured fixture results:

| fixture | before mini result | after mini result | other result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `nang128` | 61 detected, 17 matched, 18 truth | 17 detected, 17 matched, 18 truth | 68/68 blocks, 38/38 full spikes unchanged |
| `nang138` | 55 detected, 54 matched, 58 truth | 55 detected, 54 matched, 58 truth | 105/105 blocks, 26/26 full spikes unchanged |
| `nang135` | no mini truth; 76/77 blocks | unchanged | 86/86 killer blocks unchanged |
| giant `NANG_128r` source | 127 total detections | 127 total detections | adaptive reverse-palette path unchanged |

The FTFA exact benchmark remains 926/928 exact, with zero false positives,
zero shifted objects, and the same two protected boundary misses. The focused
compact support regression passes. The full suite also passes after this
batch: 304 tests in 600.394 seconds, `OK`.

## Checkpoint: miniblock primary full-spike noise (2026-08-10)

Dense 16px-cell rooms were still receiving low-confidence horizontal and
boundary full-spike candidates from late recovery stages. A final, relative
shape gate now runs only when both conditions hold: the full-spike profile is
mini-dense and the detected terrain independently has miniblock-dominant cell
topology. It measures directional triangle-side coverage, so the rule does
not depend on CN3 colors or screen names and does not route mini-spike-heavy
Irkara rooms or compact NANG rooms through the gate.

With the gate disabled versus enabled, the focused geometry measurements were:

| fixture | full spikes before | full spikes after | matched truth before | matched truth after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `cn3-16` | 69 | 35 | 26 | 26 |
| `cn3-18` | 82 | 47 | 42 | 42 |

The gate removes false candidates while retaining the same matched CN3 truth
objects. `irkara-nr-partysu3` remains unchanged at 118 detected / 90 matched
full spikes, and `nang128` and `nang138` remain at 38/38 and 26/26 full-spike
matches respectively. Their object-specific block, mini, save, warp,
water, walljump, killer-block and refresher results remain unchanged.

The exact FTFA benchmark remains `926/928 exact; 0 false positives; 2 missed;
0 shifted; 0 wrong direction`. The new directional gate regression and the
existing CN3 and compact-room geometry regressions pass. This checkpoint is
The complete suite passes at 305 tests in 561.600 seconds (`OK`). This
checkpoint is ready to be committed and pushed as a single coherent batch.
